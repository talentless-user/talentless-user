# Hi, GitHub!!! ^_^)/
## About me:
- 🌱 I am currently doing a Certificate II in Information Technologies \^_^ .
- 🐧 I love Linux \^_^ !!! I started using Linux at 01/23 with Linux Mint, and I have now been using Arch Linux since 04/23.
- 🖥️ I have very little programming skills, but I am looking to expand on my skills (in the little free time I have \=_= ).
  - I have only surface-level knowledge in Python, CSS, HTML & Shell Script, since why my username is @talentless-loser (Also maybe because of low self-esteem \~_~ ).
- 🇦🇺 I live in Australia/Queensland. My timezone is UTC+10.
